<pre><code>$ pub uploader [options] {add/remove} &lt;email&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This command allows <a href="glossary.html#uploader">uploaders</a> of a package on
<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org">pub.dartlang.org</a> to add or remove other uploaders for
that package. It has two sub-commands, <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code>, that take the email
address of the person to add/remove as an uploader. For example:</p>

<pre><code>~/code/transmogrify$ pub uploader add nweiz@google.com
'nweiz@google.com' added as an uploader for package 'transmogrify'.

~/code/transmogrify$ pub uploader remove nweiz@google.com
'nweiz@google.com' is no longer an uploader for package 'transmogrify'.
</code></pre>

<p>If a package has only one uploader, that uploader can&rsquo;t be removed. You may
remove yourself as an uploader (as long as there are other uploaders), but you
won&rsquo;t be able to re-add yourself again afterwards.</p>

<p>By default, the package in the current working directory will have its
uploaders modified. You can also pass the <code>--package</code> flag to choose a
package by name. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ pub uploader --package=transmogrify add nweiz@google.com
'nweiz@google.com' added as an uploader for package 'transmogrify'.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that uploaders are identified by their Google accounts, so use a Gmail or
Google Apps email address for any new uploaders.</p>
